# Portfolio
Hi! I'm HoLLy, C# programmer, reverse engineer and .NET enthusiast. Below, you can find a list of my public projects, categorized by topic and ordered by importance. A bit below that you should be able to find info on how and where to contact me if you need to.

## Projects

### osu!
[osu!](//osu.ppy.sh/) is a rhythm game by Dean "peppy" Herbert. It was where I found my love for programming, .NET, reverse engineering and cheat development, so it holds a special place in my heart. :)

* **[osu!HOPE](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-HOPE)** - A modifying proxy layer that allows a programmer to view and modify any in/outgoing osu!Bancho traffic. Extensible through plugins.
* **[HOPEless](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/HOPEless)** - A library for working with the osu!Bancho protocol. It can be used as base for custom/private servers. Originally created for osu!HOPE.
* **[osu! Database Reader](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-database-reader)** - A library to read any of the osu! file formats. This includes beatmaps, score-, beatmap- and collection-databases, replay files, and more.
* **[OppaiSharp](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/OppaiSharp)** - A C# port of [oppai-ng](//github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng) by Francesco149, based on its Java port [Koohii](//github.com/Francesco149/koohii). It calculates the star and PP ratings (a difficulty indicating value) for osu! beatmaps.
* [osu! PP tools](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-pp-tools) - A small tool that provides a live display with the PP values for the selected beatmap, for various accuracy values and mod combinations. Also includes a mode for mappers.
* [osu!ui skinner](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-ui-skinner) - A tool that can extract and rebuild osu!ui.dll, an osu! DLL file that contains various UI elements, shaders, fonts, audio files and more. It allows the user to create "skins" for normally unskinnable textures.
* [osu! Background Changer](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-BackgroundChanger) - A lesser version of osu!ui skinner, allows the user to modify the osu!seasonal.dll file to get custom backgrounds in the main menu without having to donate for supporter status.
* [osu! ingame background changer](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-ingame-background-changer) - Yet another image changer. This one modifies the backgrounds of *all* beatmaps by hooking the OpenFile function.

And many, many private ones :)

### .NET reverse engineering, obfuscation and deobfuscation

* **[EazFixer](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/EazFixer)** - EazFixer is a tool to deobfuscate .NET assemblies obfuscated with the commercial .NET obfuscator [EazFuscator](//www.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net). It is capable of restoring obfuscated strings, resources and embedded assemblies.
* **[Confuser.Protections.HoLLy](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/Confuser.Protections.HoLLy)** - A set of protection modules for the amazing open-source ConfuserEx obfuscator.
* [ConfuserEx](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/ConfuserEx) *[Fork]* - Documented various features and added some minor ones.

### Cheating, botting and automation

* **[SWSniff](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/SWSniff)** - A tool to sniff and inject traffic from multiplayer games for automation and exploitation. This library is focused on the Action MORPG SoulWorker, but can be easily used as a base for sniffers for  other games
* [UnovaRPGlib](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/UnovaRPGlib) - A library to programatically access the online Pokémon RPG [UnovaRPG](//www.unovarpg.com/). It allows you to automate various tasks, including grinding XP..
* [ClickerCheats](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/ClickerCheats) - A small JS snippet to provide a cheating menu in various HTML5 idle games.
* [Biertijd Downloader Reloaded](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/BiertijdDownloaderReloaded) *[NSFW]* - A tribute to one of my very first programs: an image downloader for the biertijd.xxx, a site containing erotic photoshoots. It is tiny (>50 LoC in total, 17 LoC actual logic) and very fast thanks to multi-threaded downloading.

### Others
* [DiscordCSS](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/DiscordCSS) - A list of CSS userstyles for Discord, an electron-based instant messaging app.

### Archived
These projects are abandoned and/or very bad but are of historical value.

* **[DeezSharp](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/DeezSharp)** *[DMCA'd]* - A library to to interact with the public and private API of [Deezer](//www.deezer.com/), a music streaming service similar to Spotify. This library allows you to download a track with its metadata, album information, artist information embedded as ID3v2 metadata and use the search function to find tracks.
* [BetterDiscord themes and plugins](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/BetterDiscord-Themes-and-Plugins) - A repo containing Javascript plugins or CSS styles for use with [BetterDiscord](//betterdiscord.net/home/), which alters the popular IM client Discord. A notable plugin was one to make the Discord application window transparant, which hadn't been done before. This repo is archived as I have no interest in using BetterDiscord anymore.
* [osu! custom server](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-custom-server) & [custom bancho](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/custom-bancho) - The server software that ran the very first custom osu! server (using host redirection and an unedited client). The code is horrible and the bancho part is basically a stub, but "It Works™". This project is notable because it was the first of its kind, and inspired the popular Nosue (now abandoned) and [Ripple](//ripple.moe) custom servers.
