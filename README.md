# Portfolio
Hi! I'm HoLLy, C# programmer, reverse engineer and .NET enthusiast. Below, you can find a list of my public projects, categorized by topic and ordered by importance. A bit below that you should be able to find info on how and where to contact me if you need to.

## Projects

### osu!
[osu!](//osu.ppy.sh/) is a rhythm game by Dean "peppy" Herbert. It was where I found my love for programming, .NET, reverse engineering and cheat development, so it holds a special place in my heart. :)

* **[osu!HOPE](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-HOPE)** - A modifying proxy layer that allows a programmer to view and modify any in/outgoing osu!Bancho traffic. Extensible through plugins.
* **[osu! Database Reader](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-database-reader)** - A library to read any of the osu! file formats. This includes beatmaps, score-, beatmap and collection-databases, replay files, and more.
* **[HOPEless](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/HOPEless)** - A library for working with the osu!Bancho protocol. It can be used as base for custom/private servers. Originally created for osu!HOPE.
* [OppaiSharp](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/OppaiSharp) - A C# port of [oppai-ng](//github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng) by Francesco149, based on its Java port [Koohii](//github.com/Francesco149/koohii). It calculates the star and PP ratings (a difficulty indicating value) for osu! beatmaps.
* [osu! PP tools](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-pp-tools) - A small tool that provides a live display with the PP values for the selected beatmap, for various accuracy values and mod combinations. Also includes a mode for mappers.
* [osu!ui skinner](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-ui-skinner) - A tool that can extract and rebuild osu!ui.dll, an osu! DLL that contains various UI elements. It allows the user to create "skins" for normally unskinnable textures.
* [osu! Background Changer](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-BackgroundChanger) - A lesser version of osu!ui skinner, allows the user to modify the osu!seasonal.dll file to get custom menu backgrounds, without having to donate for supporter status.
* [osu! ingame background changer](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/osu-ingame-background-changer) - Yet another image changer. This one modifies the backgrounds of *all* beatmaps by hooking the OpenFile function.

And many, many private ones :)

### .NET reverse engineering, obfuscation and deobfuscation

* **[EazFixer](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/EazFixer)** - EazFixer is a tool to deobfuscate .NET assemblies obfuscated with the commercial .NET obfuscator [EazFuscator](//www.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net). It is capable of restoring encrypted strings, resources and embedded assemblies.
* [Confuser.Protections.HoLLy](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/Confuser.Protections.HoLLy) - A set of protection modules for the open-source ConfuserEx obfuscator.
* [ConfuserEx](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/ConfuserEx) *[Fork]* - Documented various features and added some minor ones.

### Cheating, botting and automation

* **[DeezSharp](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/DeezSharp)** - A library to to interact with the public and private API of [Deezer](//www.deezer.com/), a music streaming service similar to Spotify. This library allows you to download a track with its metadata, album information, artist information and use the search function.
* [UnovaRPGlib](//github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/UnovaRPGlib) - A library to programatically access the online Pok√©mon RPG [UnovaRPG](//www.unovarpg.com/).
* [ClickerCheats](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/ClickerCheats) - A small JS snippet to provide a cheating menu in various HTML5 idle games.
* [Biertijd Downloader Reloaded](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/BiertijdDownloaderReloaded) *[NSFW]* - A tribute to one of my very first programs: a downloader for the biertijd.xxx, a site containing erotic photoshoots.
